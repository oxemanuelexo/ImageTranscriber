# Image Transcriber · GPT‑5 (No OCR)

A tiny Streamlit web app that transcribes text from images using OpenAI’s GPT‑5 (with an optional Code Interpreter tool). It does not use OCR libraries—the model looks at the pixels.
	•	Upload images or PDFs
	•	Sends one image/page per request
	•	Runs requests in parallel for speed
	•	Drag the file names to reorder; previews and final transcript follow that order
	•	Reset/Clear button to start fresh
	•	Code Interpreter toggle (on/off). If off, the prompt line about using it is removed and the tool isn’t sent.

Demo

(Optional) Add a short GIF or screenshot here showing: upload → drag names → transcribe → combined result.

⸻

Features
	•	Multiple file types: PNG, JPG/JPEG, WEBP, TIFF, BMP, GIF, and PDF
	•	PDFs are split into pages (rendered via PyMuPDF) and processed page‑by‑page
	•	Multi‑frame images (e.g., animated GIF/TIFF) use the first frame
	•	Drag‑and‑drop ordering (names): Uses streamlit-sortables.
	•	After you drag names, the image previews rearrange to match
	•	The combined transcript respects the shown order
	•	Parallel requests: Adjustable concurrency to balance speed vs. rate limits
	•	No OCR: No OCR libraries are installed or used
	•	Mac‑friendly: Simple Python deps; works great on macOS (also fine on Linux/Windows)

⸻

Requirements
	•	Python 3.9+
	•	An OpenAI API key with access to a GPT‑5 vision‑capable model
You can change the model in the app’s sidebar if needed.

Quickstart

# 1) Create & activate a virtualenv
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # macOS/Linux
# .venv\Scripts\activate   # Windows PowerShell

# 2) Install deps
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 3) Set your API key
cp .env.example .env
# then edit .env and paste your real key (OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...)

# 4) Run the app
streamlit run app.py

Open the local URL Streamlit prints (usually http://localhost:8501).

Usage
	1.	Upload images and/or a PDF.
	2.	(Optional) Drag the file names to set the order.
	•	PDFs keep their original page order (reordering disabled).
	•	After dropping, the preview grid will reflect your chosen order.
	3.	(Optional) In the sidebar, adjust:
	•	Parallel requests (concurrency)
	•	PDF render DPI (higher = crisper pages, slower)
	•	Code Interpreter (on/off)
	•	Model (defaults to gpt-5)
	4.	Click Transcribe with GPT‑5.
	5.	Review per‑image results, then copy or download the combined transcript as a .txt.

Use 🔁 Reset / Clear files (sidebar) to start over.

How it works (high level)
	•	Each image or PDF page is converted to PNG bytes (for PDFs, via PyMuPDF at your chosen DPI).
	•	The app sends exactly one input_image per request to the OpenAI Responses API using the selected model.
	•	Requests are concurrent (configurable concurrency).
	•	The system prompt forces “transcription only”. If Code Interpreter is on, the tool is attached…
	•	…and the instructions include: “You may use the code interpreter to crop, rotate, zoom… but not OCR.”
	•	If the toggle is off, that line is omitted and the tool is not sent.
	•	The individual transcripts are joined (in order) into one final output.

Project structure

.
├─ app.py                 # Streamlit app
├─ requirements.txt       # Minimal, Mac-friendly deps
└─ .env.example           # Template for OPENAI_API_KEY


⸻

Configuration
	•	OPENAI_API_KEY: set in .env
	•	Model: change in the sidebar (default gpt-5)
	•	Parallel requests: sidebar slider (1–8)
	•	PDF DPI: sidebar slider (120–300). Higher = sharper render (better transcription), but slower.

⸻

Supported inputs
	•	Images: png, jpg, jpeg, webp, tif, tiff, bmp, gif
	•	Animated images use the first frame
	•	PDF: split into pages (in document order)

HEIC isn’t included by default. If you need iPhone HEIC support, you can add pillow-heif and register it—ping me and I’ll show you how.

⸻

Limits & notes
	•	No OCR libraries are used. The model reads pixels; for tiny/blurred text, results may vary.
	•	Rate limits: If you hit 429s, lower Parallel requests.
	•	Costs: Each page/image is a separate request—keep an eye on token & image usage.
	•	Privacy: Files are sent to OpenAI to generate transcripts; nothing is stored by this app.

⸻

Troubleshooting
	•	Nothing happens / button disabled → Ensure your API key is set (sidebar or .env).
	•	“Module not found” for PyMuPDF → Reinstall deps: pip install -r requirements.txt.
	•	PDF pages look blurry → Increase PDF render DPI (try 220–260).
	•	429 / rate limit → Lower concurrency; try 2 or 3.
	•	Mixed order after dragging → The preview grid should mirror the name list after the app reruns. If not, use Reset and try again.

⸻

Extending (optional ideas)
	•	Add HEIC support via pillow-heif.
	•	Export to .md with simple heading detection (still no OCR).
	•	Optional “Unlock PDF order” to manually reorder pages.
	•	Persist session state across refreshes.

⸻

Security & privacy
	•	Your API key stays local (loaded from .env or sidebar).
	•	The app sends your uploaded files to OpenAI only to get transcriptions.
	•	No third‑party OCR or cloud storage is used.
